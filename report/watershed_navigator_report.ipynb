        "Watershed Navigator is a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based AI assistant built to answer environmental questions using relevant document contexts. Developed as an experimental integration for LimnoTech, the project explores practical ways AI could enhance LimnoTech's environmental solutions.\n",
        "\n",
